Heavy metal pollution index (HPI)
The HPI generally acknowledged all around, and the weights are assigned on the basis of inversely proportional to the standard value recommended to every element adjacent (Mohan et al., 1996):

Where Qi and Wi signify the sub-index and unit weight allocated to ith parameter and n denotes the number of considered parameters.
The sub-index for the ith parameter is anticipated by:

Where, Mi, Ii, and Si denote measured value, tolerable and allowable value respectively. According to Indian norms (BIS, 2012), the prescribed range of water quality standard is alongside WHO rules (WHO, 2011). 100 is the proposed value, which is critical for drinking water.

Contamination index (CI)
The pollution index is also known as the degree of contamination (Cd). It provides a collective impact of qualitative parameters which is considered to be harmful for drinking and household purpose (Backman et al., 1998) and is measured as follows:

Where Cfi, CAi, and CNidenote the factor of pollution, diagnostic value, and allowable concentration of the ithfactor, respectively. ‘N’ represents the ‘normative value’ and CNi is taken as maximum allowable concentration

Heavy metal evaluation index (HEI)
This technique is dependable on HPI, provides overall water quality concerning the heavy metal concentration (Edet and Offiong, 2002, Prasanna et al., 2012). The index is broadly applied for the assessment of quality of groundwater. The following equation is used for HEI calculation:

Where Mi denotes the monitored value of ith parameter of the water sample,and Si denotes the maximum admissible concentration (MAC) of the ithparameter.

Modified HPI (m-HPI)
It is a modified form of HPI by Mohan et al. (1996)

Where, m-HPIs represents modified heavy metal pollution index related to the ith heavy metal ion and calculated as

Where, Wi is the unit weight factor, inversely proportional to the maximum allowable concentration Ii and defined as,

Mi represents the measured value of theith parameter and Iirepresents the maximum desirable concentration in terms of BIS standard, it is the maximum permissible concentration in terms of WHO standard.
