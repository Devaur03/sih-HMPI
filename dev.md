Heavy metal pollution index (HPI)
The HPI generally acknowledged all around, and the weights are assigned on the basis of inversely proportional to the standard value recommended to every element adjacent (Mohan et al., 1996):

Where Qi and Wi signify the sub-index and unit weight allocated to ith parameter and n denotes the number of considered parameters.
The sub-index for the ith parameter is anticipated by:

Where, Mi, Ii, and Si denote measured value, tolerable and allowable value respectively. According to Indian norms (BIS, 2012), the prescribed range of water quality standard is alongside WHO rules (WHO, 2011). 100 is the proposed value, which is critical for drinking water.

Contamination index (CI)
The pollution index is also known as the degree of contamination (Cd). It provides a collective impact of qualitative parameters which is considered to be harmful for drinking and household purpose (Backman et al., 1998) and is measured as follows:

Where Cfi, CAi, and CNidenote the factor of pollution, diagnostic value, and allowable concentration of the ithfactor, respectively. ‘N’ represents the ‘normative value’ and CNi is taken as maximum allowable concentration
